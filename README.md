# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to implement a common CI process, which will perform some operations of the parasitic project itself. The parasitic project is usually a project generated by a project template, which generates a configuration file suitable for the ci process. The project should be suitable for monorepo, and diverse development languages. Action will analyze the user's Git Commit, and then publish the corresponding module according to the regulations. The specific regulations are as follows:  
- Branch naming rules: \<workspace>@@\<branch name>  
- commit follows the form of "\<commit type>: \<workspace>@@\<commit content>  
- Commit type has "init", "feat", "fix", "breaking change"  
- workspace is the module to be processed
- If the workplace is not set, the action works for the entire project
