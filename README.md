# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to implement a common CI process, which will perform some operations of the parasitic project itself. The parasitic project is usually a project generated by a project template, which generates a configuration file suitable for the ci process. The project should be suitable for monorepo, and diverse development languages. Action will analyze the user's Git Commit, and then publish the corresponding module according to the regulations. The specific regulations are as follows:  
- Action acts on branches master, next, alpha, beta, N.x, N.N.x  
- Branch naming rules: \<workspace>@@\<branch name>  
- commit follows the form of "\<commit type>: \<workspace>@@\<commit content>  
- Commit type has "init", "feat", "fix", "breaking change"  
- workspace is the module to be processed
- If the workplace is not set, the action publishes for the entire project

# Quick Start
```yml
name: Node.js Auto Publish

on:
  push

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
      - uses: wangziling100/AutoPublish@v1.0.0-alpha.26
        with:
          scope: '@wangziling100'
          strict_error: false
        env:
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```
No parameters are required, but usually you need to set scope and NPM_TOKEN 
## Parameter Descriptions
- scope: Scope of your package
- root_dir: Root directory of your monorepo
- strict_error: If it is true, it will report an error once it is not successfully published. If it is false, it will ignore the commit format error.
# Example
This action will not generate a release every time a module is published, but it will generate a tag for this module, like [this](https://github.com/wangziling100/AutoPublishTest/tags).
